# Land-Cover-Analysis
Use a supervised classification to predict land cover 

About these files

Optional code- this file has code to visualize landsat imagery using RGB and near infrared bands. It also calculates NDVI values and plots them. This file also includes the code to train the model. T use it, run the lines to create item 'points'. This will open an interactive map in which you can click on trianing points for a certain land cover type. When finished, press done (this can take some time to think) and run the line of code to assign the type beneath. 

NDVI Wolverine- poorly named becuase this is no longer an NDVI, but rather the rest of the code used to import landsat imagery and watershed boundaries and run the classification.
